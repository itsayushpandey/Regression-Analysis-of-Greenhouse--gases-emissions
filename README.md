## Introduction
### Monitoring the greenhouse gas emissions can be a time and resource consuming task for a lot of the industries. Both periodic measurements and continuous emission monitoring systems can be cost intensive as they would require constant monitoring of the sensors used to measure the gas emissions. Research was published by the Turkish journal of Electrical and Computer Science department to tackle this issue. The research proposes a predictive emission monitoring system (PEM) that predicts the emissions of CO and NOx using calibrated equipment established on site. The researchers set a benchmark for the predictive models built and this project is an attempt to apply statistical methods for the data

## Conclusion
### Through this paper we test the statistical significance of a predictive emission monitoring system (PEM). The paper we based this research on did sophisticated neural networks. Considering we achieved comparable results with statistical modeling which is more interpretable and explainable would mean that the 9 features used can very well be used to set up a PEM. There could be more uses to this model like building confidence intervals for each predictors to set up triggers when the emissions exceed the limit set up.
